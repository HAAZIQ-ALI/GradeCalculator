# GradeCalculator

This project is a simple Grade Calculator implemented in C++ that calculates both the percentage and CGPA based on the marks entered for 5 subjects. Each subject is graded out of 100, and the program computes the overall percentage and CGPA accordingly.

## Features
- **Percentage Calculation:** The program calculates the percentage based on the total marks out of 500.
- **CGPA Calculation:** The program converts the total marks to CGPA on a scale of 10.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter the marks for 5 subjects (each out of 100).
2. The program calculates and displays the percentage.
3. The program then calculates and displays the CGPA (out of 10).

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (g++ or any compatible C++ compiler)
- Standard C++ library
